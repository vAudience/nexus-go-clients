and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewHealthResponseWithDefaults

`func NewHealthResponseWithDefaults() *HealthResponse`

`func (o *HealthResponse) GetHealth() string`

GetHealth returns the Health field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetHealthOk

GetHealthOk returns a tuple with the Health field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.
